| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                             I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
|         |             |                                                                                                          Starting thinking of the code. Trying to brainstorm shortcuts such as only looking at words that share the first letter to narrow dictionary. |
| 3/7     | 12:40-1:40  | New idea. Make a tree that focuses on the subtraction, substitution, and additionaing. have the tree branch into three branches one for each step. ENd branch when the word no longer fits in dictionary. Make a dictionary trie to check efficaiantly |
| 3/12    | 11:30-11:55 |                                                                                                                                                                                           LEarned about how to compare LD. strated coding the LD code. |
| 3/14    |   9- 9:50   |                                                     Finished making the LD code. The  made a code that goes through all words in dictionary and returns words by LD distance. Currently returning too many words so I think I need to debug my LD code |

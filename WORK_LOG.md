| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
|         |             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Starting thinking of the code. Trying to brainstorm shortcuts such as only looking at words that share the first letter to narrow dictionary. |
| 3/7     | 12:40-1:40  |                                                                                                                                      New idea. Make a tree that focuses on the subtraction, substitution, and additionaing. have the tree branch into three branches one for each step. ENd branch when the word no longer fits in dictionary. Make a dictionary trie to check efficaiantly |
| 3/12    | 11:30-11:55 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                LEarned about how to compare LD. strated coding the LD code. |
| 3/14    |   9- 9:50   |                                                                                                                                                                                          Finished making the LD code. The  made a code that goes through all words in dictionary and returns words by LD distance. Currently returning too many words so I think I need to debug my LD code |
| 3/17    |     2-3     | Found error in LD. First I was ignoring the first letter causing the last row + column to be all 0. Then I removed that row mistakely thinking I added an extra row. Realized that mistale and did 0 on their own and did the LD correctly, but only did 0 length for word.length -1 instead of actual length making it once again off by one, but I fixed that so it now passes all checks |
| 3/19    | 12:40-1:40  |                                                                                                                                                                                                    Started brainstorming spedups. Thought by first letter but that wouldn't work, so first implemnted that only for letters within the threshold if greater then mispelled + threshold skip |
| 3/24    |   8-9:30    |                                                                                  Worked on making code that ask for user input of misspelled words. At first I used binaray search to find if word exist in dictionary, but after asking alex I made a hashset for dictionary to have constant lookups. And after testing my user imput gets speeled words with a threshold of 2 very quick |
| 3/24    | 9:30-10:30  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Started to make read mes and time complexities. Finished Read me and time complexity |
